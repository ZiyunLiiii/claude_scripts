# 4D Reconstruction — Progress

## Status
- 4D MACE: working multi-GPU implementation, DCT dejittering integrated, null-space projection under investigation
- Single-view: literature search in progress

## Log

### 2026-08-07
- 4D MACE script shared; DCT-I dejittering (period=6, harmonics) applied in forward + prior agents
- Issue identified: direct dejitter may violate AX = y → null-space projection idea: x + (I - A⁺A)(Px - x)
- Single-view project scoped: plume in pork belly, fixed-angle + steady-state CBCT reference
- Created Claude_scripts/4Drecon tracking folder; Lilly proposal draft started in Overleaf
